## The Problem

The AI field moves at breakneck speed. Hundreds of papers, blog posts, product launches, and tweets every day. Even following the right people on Twitter isn't enough — you still need to read, filter, and synthesize.

**The result?** You either spend hours doom-scrolling or miss important developments entirely.

## The Solution

Andrej Karpathy — one of the most respected voices in AI — maintains a carefully curated set of RSS sources covering the most important AI publications and blogs. This skill turns that curated feed into a **structured daily briefing** with one command.

1. **Karpathy-Curated Sources** — Only the feeds that matter, selected by someone who deeply understands the field
2. **AI-Powered Synthesis** — Reads full articles, extracts key points, identifies themes
3. **Structured Output** — Organized by topic with data summaries and editorial observations
4. **Real-time Data** — Fetches live RSS content via [YouMind RSS Pack](https://youmind.com/rss/pack/andrej-karpathy-curated-rss), always up to date

Data powered by [YouMind](https://youmind.com) RSS Pack — reliable feed aggregation for AI-native workflows.

## Example Conversations

```
You: "Give me today's AI briefing"
AI:  → Fetches Karpathy's RSS feeds → Reads top articles → Generates structured briefing

You: "What's new in AI today?"
AI:  → Same flow, detects language, outputs accordingly

You: "Any recent progress on LLM reasoning?"
AI:  → Fetches feeds → Filters for reasoning/inference topics → Focused briefing

You: "Summarize this week's AI highlights"
AI:  → Expands to 7-day window → Weekly digest
```

## Use with OpenClaw 🦞

This skill is a perfect fit for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) as an automated daily cron job. Set it up once, and wake up to a fresh AI briefing in your Telegram/Discord/Slack every morning.

### Quick Setup

**Step 1: Install the skill**

```bash
npx skills i YouMind-OpenLab/karpathy-rss-daily-skill
```

**Step 2: Create a cron job**

Just paste this into your OpenClaw chat (customize the **time** and **language** to your preference):

> Set up a daily cron job at **8:00 AM** that runs the karpathy-rss-daily-skill to generate an AI news briefing **in English**. Fetch the RSS feeds from https://youmind.com/rss/pack/andrej-karpathy-curated-rss, read the top stories from the past 24 hours, and send me a structured briefing with key themes, takeaways, and editor's notes.

Change `8:00 AM` to your preferred time, and `in English` to any language (`in Chinese`, `in Japanese`, `in Spanish`, etc.).

OpenClaw will automatically:
- Create an isolated cron job on the schedule you specified
- Fetch and synthesize Karpathy's curated feeds daily
- Deliver the briefing to your connected chat (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)

**That's it.** No code, no config files, no API keys. Just tell your agent what you want.

### Example Cron Configuration

For those who prefer manual setup via the OpenClaw config or CLI:

```json
{
  "name": "karpathy-daily-briefing",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 8 * * *", "tz": "America/New_York" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run the karpathy-rss-daily-skill: Fetch the RSS pack from https://youmind.com/rss/pack/andrej-karpathy-curated-rss, read the top articles from the past 24h, and generate a structured daily briefing with themes, key takeaways, and editor's notes. Output in English. (Change to: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, etc.)",
    "timeoutSeconds": 180
  },
  "delivery": { "mode": "announce" }
}
```
